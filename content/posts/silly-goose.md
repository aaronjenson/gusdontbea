"9 Lives" (s1,e5) starts with Shawn and Gus taking a walk down the street as they have a much-needed heart-to-heart. In a
strangely out-of-character move, Shawn begins to take a real interest in Gus' mental state. As they continue their walk,
Gus takes this opportunity to vent a little bit. 

At this point, Shawn and Gus are new to this job as psychic detectives, and while Shawn is having the time of his life
with a job that fits his irresponsible and relaxed lifestyle, Gus is experiencing only added stress as Shawn's antics
place him in physical, mental, financial, and emotional turmoil.

Shawn is quick to agree with Gus, promising a break from detective work for the near future to allow Gus a chance to
recoup. An immediate feeling of relief comes over Gus, and he shares with Shawn that he was a little bit hesitant to
tell Shawn about his burnt-out state, implying that he was worried Shawn's reaction would discount his concern, while
emphasizing the comfort this brings him.

In Shawn's reply to Gus' concern, we get the titular phrase, "Gus, don't be a silly goose," in which Shawn reinforces
their close bond by effectively saying "I'm always here for you," or "don't ever hesitate to express your concerns."
Moments later, Shawn and Gus arrive at their destination for this walk which it is apparent was a surprise to Gus, an
apartment complex with a collection of police vehicles parked out front.

Even as they walk into the crime scene, Shawn and Gus both repeat their promise of "no cases" to each other, and Shawn
states they'll just take a look around real quick without getting involved in the investigation. As you can imagine, it
doesn't take long before Shawn is convinced the police have the complete wrong idea about the mode of death, and they
embark on this case anyway in yet another anxiety inducing adventure for Gus.
