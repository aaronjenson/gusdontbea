      <description>&amp;ldquo;9 Lives&amp;rdquo; (s1,e5) starts with Shawn and Gus taking a walk down the street as they have a much-needed heart-to-heart. In a strangely out-of-character move, Shawn begins to take a real interest in Gus&#39; mental state. As they continue their walk, Gus takes this opportunity to vent a little bit.
At this point, Shawn and Gus are new to this job as psychic detectives, and while Shawn is having the time of his life with a job that fits his irresponsible and relaxed lifestyle, Gus is experiencing only added stress as Shawn&amp;rsquo;s antics place him in physical, mental, financial, and emotional turmoil.</description>
